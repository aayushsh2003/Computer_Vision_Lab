# 🖼️ Computer Vision Lab

This repository contains all the experiments and programs implemented as part of the **Computer Vision Lab** (7th Semester, Poornima College of Engineering).  
It demonstrates fundamental image processing and computer vision techniques using **Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image**.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the required libraries before running the experiments:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Key Dependencies**  
- Python 3.10+ / 3.12  
- OpenCV → `pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python`  
- NumPy → `pip install numpy`  
- Matplotlib → `pip install matplotlib`  
- scikit-image → `pip install scikit-image`

## ▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/aayushsh2003/Computer_Vision_Lab.git
cd Computer_Vision_Lab

text

Run any experiment (example for Experiment 2):

python "Experiment 2/Experiment2.py"

text

Output images will be displayed and also saved in respective folders like `output_images/` or `fft_output/`.
